## Chad O, CEO

Chad was already a ten-year veteran of the Web2 startup and
consultancy worlds before moving into Web3 in 2019. His initial work in Web3 was
with a startup building Dapps in the Ethereum DAO space, before joining the
Developer Experience team at Near Inc in 2020 Near Inc at the time was, the
company building NEAR Protocol, a sharded blockchain with Web Assembly smart
contracts authored in Rust. Chad is a well-enjoyed public speaker, with a
special talent for making complex topics understandable to a broad audience.
This drive to simplify the complex also led to his cofounding of Aha Labs in
20242, where they focus on making blockchain more accessible to developers of
all skill levels.

Enzo is a graduate of CentraleSup√©lec and ESSEC Business School, where he
distinguished himself in the field of entrepreneurship. Today, his dual
background gives him a unique vision, combining technical expertise with a keen
understanding of the business issues at stake in the blockchain ecosystem. This
versatility was particularly evident in his role as CEO of Tenk, a Web3 studio,
where he successfully steered the development of innovative solutions. His
experience in supporting blockchain projects via Fungible Strategy demonstrates
his ability to identify market opportunities and transform complex technical
concepts into viable business solutions.

## Willem Wyndham, CTO

Willem brings a high level of academic and technical expertise,
initially forged during his thesis work in programming at the University of
Maryland, where he specialized in programming languages and computer security.
He then decided to interrupt his PhD to join NEAR Protocol as a researcher,
focusing particularly on the RUST language. His position as Contract Runtime
Engineer enabled him to develop an in-depth understanding of the technical
challenges of blockchain and the solutions to overcome them. His unique
background, combining academic research and practical development, gives him a
particularly relevant perspective on the evolution of blockchain technologies
and their potential for innovation. His mastery of blockchain execution
environments, his deep expertise in RustRUST and his vision of security issues
make him the ideal expert to lead the technical development of advanced
blockchain solutions.
