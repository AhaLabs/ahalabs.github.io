## 1. DevX Audit

Get your software platform ready for mass adoption.

Your developer onboarding journey is the top of your funnel.
The front door, for your most crucial audience.

Maybe you have a B2D2C business model (that's "Business to Developers to
Consumers"), or a developer platform that's otherwise crucial to your strategy.

Is the front door working?

We get it: making new platforms is hard! It requires intense collaboration
between interdisciplinary teams. We've been on these teams! Early on,
just getting anything to work is heroic. Developer docs and developer
experience become an afterthought in that scramble to have anything at all.
And besides, early on, everyone working on your platform is paid to be there.
They have full workdays to work through traps and sharp edges.

Your target audience doesn't have that luxury. They're going to give you an hour,
maybe 30 minutes. They're going to spend a single, precious evening with you.
Will your onboarding journey convince them to give you a second date? Will they
feel a spark? Will they end that first half hour feeling like they know why your
product exists, what it's good for, and like they could build something awesome?

With our DevX Audit, we will go through your developer onboarding journey and
give you an in-depth report. This won't just cover the documentation: we'll also
analyze your core developer tools and make suggestions for how to improve them.
We've built these tools for other platforms. We're experts who can work through
your rough edges and gaps in documentation. And we're empathic teachers, who
understand the challenges faced by beginners. The report we generate will dive
into all aspects of your core developer onboarding journey, giving you
actionable next-steps to ensure developers start building great things on your
platform.

Our DevX Audit is priced competitively, making it easy to justify as a low-level
grant/engagement from your foundation or partnership department.
