## 1. Developer Experience (DevX) Audit

Get your software platform ready for mass adoption.

Your developer onboarding journey is the top of your funnel.
The front door, for your most crucial audience.

Maybe you have a B2D2C business model (that's "Business to Developers to
Consumers"), or a developer platform that's otherwise crucial to your strategy.

**Is the front door working?**

We get it: making new platforms is hard! It requires intense collaboration
between interdisciplinary teams. [We've been on these teams!](/team) Early on,
just getting anything to work is heroic. Developer docs and developer
experience become an afterthought in that scramble to have anything at all.
And besides, early on, everyone working on your platform is paid to be there.
They have full workdays to work through traps and sharp edges.

Your target audience doesn't have that luxury. They're going to give you an hour,
maybe 30 minutes. They're going to spend a single, precious evening with you.
Will your onboarding journey convince them to give you a second date? Will they
feel a spark? Will they end that first half hour feeling like they know why your
product exists, what it's good for, and like they could build something awesome?

With our DevX Audit, we will go through your developer onboarding journey and
give you an in-depth report. We're experts who can work through
your rough edges and gaps in documentation. And we're empathic teachers, who
understand the challenges faced by beginners. Here's what we'll do:

1. For small issues—typos, inconsistences, out-of-date information—we'll send
   immediate code change requests (GitHub calls these Pull Requests). This is
   basic, baseline Open Source etiquette.
2. Beyond that, we'll consider your documentation at a more holistic level. Does
   it make sense to your core audience? How does it need to be restructured to
   quickly orient developers of diverse skill and background? When a developer gives
   you that first half hour, will they be able to move your product from their
   list of "unknown unknowns" to "known unknowns"? Will they feel empowered;
   will they be excited to come back?
3. We'll probably recommend that your documentation provide a quick end-to-end
   overview, in the form of a tutorial, as the first touch-point for developers.
   This tutorial should only require 3 to 5 steps, and should take 20 to 30
   minutes for skilled developers. What needs to change, in your core tooling,
   to make that possible? We'll make extensive recommendations at all levels of
   your software stack: core SDKs, Command Line Interfaces, JavaScript
   libraries, testing frameworks, and more. Even more than analyzing what's there,
   we'll analyze what's not. Are there gaps in your tooling? Just as your
   documentation might require reorganization, so too might your tooling.

Our report will give you actionable next-steps to ensure developers start
building great things on your platform. We'll then schedule a Report Readout
Meeting, to go over the report with you and answer any outstanding questions.

Our DevX Audit is priced competitively, making it easy to justify as a low-level
grant/engagement.

### 🔖 Case Study: Starknet

[Starknet](https://www.starknet.io/) is a Layer 2 network for Ethereum that harnesses Zero Knowledge proofs to enhance privacy and speed. Two of our engineers went through their onboarding documentation over the course of a week, creating three documents for them:

1. [Analysis of the Core Onboarding Journey](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z5_nkwNhxXitz6PYeUZu-avv6gGrWuDTXsL25luAh4I/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.hmhw8fbeiiq5): high-level feedback about our onboarding experience as a whole
2. [Suggestions for their CLI](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17OaiXeSVJH1bEJVVNx_ZiWmJZsbgF9vAdEMcHNZYIwM/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.wf127bwxcmvq): given the central role that Command Line Interfaces play in a developer's workflow, we wanted to encourage Starknet to make a variety of both small and large improvements to the ergonomics of their CLI
3. [A Short Explanation of Loam](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fHkrZeQMj_v4xzne8g4toKRa71Q-EKW_oR71_Cn1lPo/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.pp9a87xx5ks8): the Starknet team specifically asked us to imagine what our [Loam](https://loam.build/) offering might look like, if it were extended to work with Starknet

After receiving our feedback, the team decided that Loam is not interesting to them at this time, but we hopped on a call to discuss our DevX Audit and determine next steps. Shortly after we got their team this feedback, they were [able to](https://github.com/starknet-io/starknet-docs/pull/1480) restructure their docs to incorporate some of our suggestions.

## 2. Financial Institutions Custom Development

Unlock next-generation financial services through blockchain.

Your financial institution faces familiar yet daunting challenges: high remittance costs, lengthy transfer times, endless reconciliation overhead, and unyielding threats from fraud. And banking is changing—fast. Stablecoins, CBDCs, and new digital payment innovations aren’t just buzzwords; they’re your competition’s blueprint for staying ahead.

We get it: Large, regulated institutions have countless pressures—compliance, security, risk management, and legacy infrastructure to name a few. Introducing a new technology can feel like changing the engine mid-flight. But blockchain is at a tipping point. It’s not just hype; it’s a real, tangible tool that can reduce costs, open new revenue streams, and help you capture your slice of tomorrow’s financial ecosystem.

### Our Approach

At Aha Labs, we specialize in **tailored blockchain solutions** for banks and financial institutions. We’re not just blockchain fans tinkering in a vacuum; we’ve worked alongside top-20 global banks, building systems that attack real-world bottlenecks head-on. We’ve also interviewed dozens of blockchain consultants at leading firms like KPMG and Accenture, so we know what works, what doesn’t, and most importantly, **why**.

We won’t force a one-size-fits-all product into your world. Instead, we start by listening to your unique pain points. From there, we deliver a solution that fits seamlessly within your environment—no matter how regulated or complex—because your competitive edge depends on it.

### Key Areas We Address

- **Payment Systems**: Speed up settlement times, reduce remittance costs, and mitigate fraud risk.

- **Asset Tokenization**: Represent traditionally illiquid assets (like real estate) on-chain, creating new revenue opportunities and improving liquidity.

- **Stablecoins & CBDCs**: Enter the digital currency space with confidence, benefiting from lower fees and near-instant settlement.

### Our Process

1. Discovery & Roadmap
   - Collaborative Workshops: We begin by mapping your current systems, bottlenecks, and strategic goals.
   - Compliance & Risk Alignment: Our specialists work alongside your risk and compliance teams to ensure all regulatory requirements and data security standards are met from day one.
   - Solution Blueprint: We then craft a clear, step-by-step roadmap that highlights high-impact use cases, data flows, and integration points—bridging old and new seamlessly.

2. Proof of Concept (PoC)
   - Technical Validation: We build a lightweight PoC to confirm feasibility for your chosen focus; be it payment rails, asset tokenization, or otherwise.
   - Performance & Security: We subject the PoC to rigorous tests to ensure it meets banking standards for latency, throughput, fraud detection, and data protection.
   - Stakeholder Buy-In: Through demos, documentation, and training, we help you showcase blockchain’s potential and secure alignment with decision-makers.

3. Full-Scale Implementation
   - Custom Development: Our engineers develop production-grade smart contracts, APIs, and integration layers, tying seamlessly into existing systems like core banking and KYC/AML solutions.
   - Change Management: Introducing new tech involves more than just code. We coordinate closely with operations, compliance, and legal teams to make sure everyone’s on board.
   - Security & Compliance: Together with security experts, we conduct thorough audits so your new systems meet, or exceed, regulations like GDPR, FINRA, and other jurisdiction-specific standards.

4. Ongoing Support & Optimization
   - Monitoring & Maintenance: Choose from tiered support packages post-launch, including 24/7 monitoring, SLA-based response times, and regular check-ups.
   - Upgrades & Feature Enhancements: As blockchain evolves, so should your infrastructure. We regularly review your solution and can implement new features—so you stay ahead of market opportunities.
