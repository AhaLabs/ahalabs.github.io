## 1. Developer Experience Audit

Get your software platform ready for mass adoption.

Your developer onboarding journey is the top of your funnel.
The front door, for your most crucial audience.

Maybe you have a B2D2C business model (that's "Business to Developers to
Consumers"), or a developer platform that's otherwise crucial to your strategy.

Is the front door working?

We get it: making new platforms is hard! It requires intense collaboration
between interdisciplinary teams. [We've been on these teams!](./team) Early on,
just getting anything to work is heroic. Developer docs and developer
experience become an afterthought in that scramble to have anything at all.
And besides, early on, everyone working on your platform is paid to be there.
They have full workdays to work through traps and sharp edges.

Your target audience doesn't have that luxury. They're going to give you an hour,
maybe 30 minutes. They're going to spend a single, precious evening with you.
Will your onboarding journey convince them to give you a second date? Will they
feel a spark? Will they end that first half hour feeling like they know why your
product exists, what it's good for, and like they could build something awesome?

With our DevX Audit, we will go through your developer onboarding journey and
give you an in-depth report. We're experts who can work through
your rough edges and gaps in documentation. And we're empathic teachers, who
understand the challenges faced by beginners. Here's what we'll do:

1. For small issues—typos, inconsistences, out-of-date information—we'll send
   immediate code change requests (GitHub calls these Pull Requests). This is
   basic, baseline Open Source etiquette.
2. Beyond that, we'll consider your documentation at a more holistic level. Does
   it make sense to your core audience? How does it need to be restructured to
   quickly orient developers of diverse skill and background? When a developer gives
   you that first half hour, will they be able to move your product from their
   list of "unknown unknowns" to "known unknowns"? Will they feel empowered;
   will they be excited to come back?
3. We'll probably recommend that your documentation provide a quick end-to-end
   overview, in the form of a tutorial, as the first touch-point for developers.
   This tutorial should only require 3 to 5 steps, and should take 20 to 30
   minutes for skilled developers. What needs to change, in your core tooling,
   to make that possible? We'll make extensive recommendations at all levels of
   your software stack: core SDKs, Command Line Interfaces, JavaScript
   libraries, testing frameworks, and more. Even more than analyzing what's there,
   we'll analyze what's not. Are there gaps in your tooling? Just as your
   documentation might require reorganization, so too might your tooling.

Our report will give you actionable next-steps to ensure developers start
building great things on your platform. We'll then schedule a Report Readout
Meeting, to go over the report with you and answer any outstanding questions.

Our DevX Audit is priced competitively, making it easy to justify as a low-level
grant/engagement.
