Here are the interesting parts.\n\nYou can learn more about NEAR Foundation grants here: [near.org/grants](https://near.org/grants/). The application copied below currently lives [on Airtable](https://airtable.com/shrY3sDi7JnWtLNI6).\n\n\n# NEAR Foundation Grants Program\n\nThis application is for entrepreneurs, developers, researchers, and advocates looking to contribute to the NEAR ecosystem. You might be looking to bootstrap your project on NEAR, add funds to your DAO’s treasury, or conduct research on the social impacts of decentralization. The NEAR Foundation (NF) welcomes all projects interested in building a more scalable, equitable, and creative future on NEAR.\n\nPlease make sure to fill out all sections of the application. While you should provide clear details of your project timelines and scope, an application with lengthy responses is not necessarily preferable! We read through many submissions, so if you can concisely convey your ideas, we would greatly appreciate it. All applications will be received and reviewed on a rolling basis. Only one application per individual and/or team can be submitted at a time.\n\nAfter completing your project’s pre-specified milestones, an individual or team can re-apply for another grant. Grants are issued in NEAR tokens but payment methods such as USD/ EUR can be issued in exceptional circumstances.\n\nNEAR Foundation offers different grant tracks of support depending on your current stage. A guide can be found here: \n[https://bit.ly/Grant_Track_Guide_NF](https://bit.ly/Grant_Track_Guide_NF)\n\nYou will receive a follow up email to confirm your application has been received and separately when the review process has started. If you have questions that aren’t answered on near.org/grants, please contact us via email at grants@near.foundation.\n\n# What is the name of your project?\n\nAha Labs\n\n# Which grant track are you applying for?\n\n_Grant tracks found here: [https://bit.ly/Grant_Track_Guide_NF](https://bit.ly/Grant_Track_Guide_NF)_\n\nOpen Source Infrastructure Grant\n\n# Grant Category\n\nInfrastructure / Wallets\n\n# Please describe your project in 2-3 sentences.\n_Limit: 100 words._\n\nCreate the best developer experience of any blockchain, with the most succinct and compelling path for Web2 developers.

The rest of our team as Pixel8 received a grant to build [NEAR Tooling](https://neartooling.com/).\n\n# Project Website URL\n\n[https://raen.dev](https://raen.dev), [https://AhaLabs.dev](https://AhaLabs.dev), [https://pixel8.io](https://pixel8.io)\n\n# Github Project URL\n\n[https://github.com/raendev](https://github.com/raendev), [https://github.com/AhaLabs](https://github.com/AhaLabs), [https://github.com/Pixel8-LLC](https://github.com/Pixel8-LLC)\n\n# How much funding are you requesting? Please specify the exact amount you are requesting in USD.\n_E.g. $50,000. Grants will be given in USD value of NEAR tokens. (Benchmark: average grant <$50K USD)_\n\n$420,000 (for 6 months with current team + 3 new hires)\n\n# How far along is your project?\n_Ideation phase, MVP, or maybe you've already launched—woohoo!_\n\nWe've already launched—woohoo!\n\n# When is the expected project launch date on NEAR?*\n_mm/dd/yyyy_\n\n06/27/2022\n\n# What are you building & why?\n\nThe biggest gap in NEAR's current tooling & education exists between \"hackathon Proof-of-Concept\" and \"full-scale app\". How's a hacker to evolve a weekend project into a well-architected codebase that serves a userbase of millions? What are the best current patterns for building on the Open Web, and how can a builder upgrade to the latest patterns \"for free\", harnessing the research and development of the whole ecosystem, rather than re-performing the research themselves?\n\nRAEN has already laid the foundation for tooling that answers these questions. This grant will give us six months of runway to expand this offering, allowing us to evolve it into the \"Ruby on Rails\" of the Open Web: a framework, CLI tool, and related infrastructure to allow builders to quickly iterate on ambitious decentralized apps.\n\nCentral to the Open Web vision are thin apps that access open data. That is, apps that incorporate data from many smart contracts. RAEN will support this in three ways: 1. Making it easy to build apps that integrate with existing, deployed smart contracts; 2. Building a no-code \"Contract Store\" app that allows people to quickly launch their own version of a contract, such as the many NFT projects that forked the TENK smart contract with minor modification (for a partial list, see [https://ahalabs.dev/posts/near-edu-fellowship-recap](https://ahalabs.dev/posts/near-edu-fellowship-recap)); and 3. Providing OpenZeppelin-type templates and building blocks, giving smart contract authors quick starting points and secure patterns to build on.\n\n# What makes you different from your competitors?\n_Why are you the one? :)_\n\nA collective 8 years experience of 1. building tools that are both more powerful and easier to use than the competition, 2. launching well-loved apps in the NEAR ecosystem, and 3. explaining concepts in accessible ways that a broad audience of web2 and web3 developers can understand. See our team description above.\n\n# What are your project milestones and estimated budget for each step (Please list)? And when are the expected delivery dates for each milestone?\n_Guidelines for completing milestones: [https://bit.ly/Grant-Milestone-Guide-NF](https://bit.ly/Grant-Milestone-Guide-NF)_\n\n### Milestone 1: NEAR Contract Store soft launch  \n_(Month 1, $70k)_\n\n  - NEAR Riffs v1 released with usable documentation & good branding\n  - Web UI to self-service launch a contract\n  - DAO to manage submissions of new contracts to Store\n  - Subgraph-driven dashboard tracking launched contracts\n\n### Milestone 2: RAEN refinements  \n_(Month 2, $35k)_\n\n  - Branding (outsourced)\n  - Embed Wit in contracts instead of JSON Schema\n  - TypeScript-to-Wit generator\n  - RAEN Admin: Complex data input UX (e.g. date inputs for dates, not numbers)\n  - Rust SDK `allow` macro (supersede `/// @allow` comments)\n  - RAEN Admin: Sign into multiple contracts at once (work around near-api-js limitation)\n\n### Milestone 3: Ecosystem development  \n_(Month 2, $35k)_\n\n  - NEAR Tooling: Add Linkdrop indexing\n  - RAEN Admin-like contract explorer in nearblocks.io\n  - Collaborate with popular NEAR projects to release RAEN-built versions\n    (wrap.near, USN, Ref Finance, Burrow, Paras, Mintbase, NFT Secret\n    Skellies, NFT TAYC, ...)\n  - Measuring success: Index all deployed contracts; check if built with RAEN\n\n### Milestone 4: Verified secondary RAEN schema fallback system  \n_(Month 3, $70k)_\n\n  - DAO to manage submissions of fallback RAEN schemas\n  - Web app to wrap DAO and allow easy browsing of schemas\n  - Collaborate with Jacob Lindahl's contract [registry](https://github.com/NEAR-Edu/contract-registry)\n\n### Milestone 5: Wit-to-X generators, where X equals:  \n_(Month 4, $70k)_\n\n  - Interactive contract CLI\n  - Cross-Contract Call logic for contract developers\n      - Rust contract boilerplate\n      - TypeScript contract boilerplate\n  - TypeScript for app devs\n  - [OpenRPC](https://open-rpc.org/)\n  - Pagoda's [upcoming ABI](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/blob/41eb838b0d745394d7530aabe363f80dfc649a0c/near-sdk/src/private)\n  - Subgraphs\n\n### Milestone 6: OpenZeppelin-like contract composition  \n_(Month 5, $70k)_\n\n  - `raen generate contract (nft|ft|dao|etc)` to fetch same template contracts used by Contract Store\n  - `raen generate scaffold` to also generate associated Subgraph & TypeScript\n  - `raen use [some-contract.testnet|some-contract.near]` to generate Subgraph & TypeScript from deployed contract\n\n### Milestone 7: Education & tutorials  \n_(Month 6, $70k)_\n  - Expand [The Guide](https://raen.dev/guide)\n      - Use launcher to allow users to deploy contracts from guide\n      - Embed admin contract interface to call contracts from guide\n  - Launch [Raenville](https://github.com/raendev/raenville) full dapp tutorial for web2 audience\n\n# Is your project open-source?\n\nYes\n\n# Which components of the project will be open source?\n_Please provide as much detail as possible._\n\nEvery single one\n\n# How will this impact the NEAR Ecosystem?\n\nOur tools and resources will lower barries to entry, making NEAR the easiest blockchain to learn and build for, hands-down. App developers will feel confident launching and rapidly iterating on ambitious Open Web apps that integrate with contracts throughout the ecosystem, creating a Glory Of The Commons, positive-sum race to the top. Whatever people's entry point — whether the no-code blackbox solutions on the Contract Store or the turn-key OpenZeppelin-like templates from the RAEN CLI — a huge new swath of web2 and web3 creators will feel empowered to build their moonshots on NEAR, wrapping businesses and public infrastructure around the well-architected codebases RAEN helps them launch and maintain for the long-term.\n\n# What makes you excited about NEAR?\n\nMost developer-friendly:\n- runs any language that compiles to WebAssembly\n- dynamic re-sharding design\n\nMost user-friendly:\n- account name system\n- function-call access keys with network allowance (no confirming every single transaction!)\n- NEAR Wallet (no downloads! works by default on mobile!)\n\n# How will you measure project success?\n_What will success look like for your project? An example can be number of sign ups, active users, total TVL, NEAR ecosystem impact etc._\n\nIn order of importance:\n\n- Number of deployed contracts built with RAEN over time. Correlate with other known events, such as marketing campaigns and conferences, to approximate:\n    - web2 converts to NEAR\n    - web3 converts to NEAR from other chains\n- Partnerships completed. Factor in partnership size so that a complex partnership counts for more than a simple one.\n- Total downloads of published packages\n- Visits to web properties, tracked using Plausible.io\n- Conference talks given (including virtual); audience size\n- Video views\n- Twitter followers\n\n# Links to Video(s) \n_Please upload any videos to some video hosting platform (e.g. YouTube/Vimeo/etc.) and add the link(s) below:_\n\n### [Introducing RAEN](https://youtu.be/m5dOyaKp18Y) (2min)\n\n<div class=\"responsiveVideoWrap\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m5dOyaKp18Y\" title=\"Introducing RAEN: YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n\n### [Status & Vision](https://youtu.be/i3W2kgRLqew) (6min)\n\n<div class=\"responsiveVideoWrap\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i3W2kgRLqew\" title=\"RAEN Status & Vision: YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n\n# Please include any helpful materials such as roadmap, video demonstration, pitch deck etc. A pitch deck is compulsory for project requesting over $100,000.\n_Select up to **3 files** to attach.\nAcceptable file types: .csv, .doc, .docx, .odt, .pdf, .rtf, .txt, .wpd, .wpf, .gif, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .svg, .tif, .tiff, .3gp, .avi, .flv, .m4v, .mkv, .mov, .mp4, .mpg, .webm, .wmv, .epub, .key, .mobi, .mus, .musx, .ppt, .pptx, .sib, .xls, .xlsx, .zip_\n\n- [Pitch Deck](https://raen.dev/vision-talk/ahalabs-pitch.pdf)\n- [as HTML](https://raen.dev/vision-talk/standalone/)\n\n<div class=\"responsiveVideoWrap\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://raen.dev/vision-talk/ahalabs-pitch.pdf\" title=\"Aha Labs Pitch\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\n# Are you currently raising a round (or do you have plans to do so in the future)? \n_If yes, please tick the box below._\n\nNo\n\n# How did you hear about the NEAR Grants Program? \n_Please tell us how you found this program!\nDid you hack with us, see us in a newsletter, or something else?_\n\nWe all worked with NEAR previously\n\n# Did someone refer you to the NF Grants Program? \n\nSherif Abushadi, Cameron Dennis, Matt Lockyer, Dani Osorio, and others.
